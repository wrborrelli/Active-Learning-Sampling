# Active Learning Experiment Sampling 

This code does soft max experiment sampling for active learning applications. 

## Usage
All calls to the function are completed by inputting the correct model, followed by either the amine of choice and descriptor or just the correct sampling dataset.
```bash
sample[model_ClassifierFunction, amine_String, descriptor_String] 
sample[model_ClassifierFunction, samplingDF_Dataset] 
```
